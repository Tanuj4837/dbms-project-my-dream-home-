## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-management.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up MySQL:

   - Create a database named `realestate` in your MySQL instance.
   - Import the database schema (tables and initial data) as required.
   - Update the database configuration in the `app.js` file as needed.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
2. Access the application in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Use the login pages to authenticate as **admin**, **agent**, or **office** users. The roles have different access privileges for adding, updating, or deleting records.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login for `admin`, `agent`, and `office` users.
- **Agent Management**: Admin users can add or delete agents from the system.
- **Property Management**: Add, view, and update property listings, including seller and buyer details.
- **Transaction Records**: Store and update transaction data related to property sales.
- **Dynamic Query Execution**: Admins can run SQL queries dynamically.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and handling across different pages.
